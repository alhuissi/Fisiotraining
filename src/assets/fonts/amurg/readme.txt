This DEMO font is for PERSONAL USE ONLY! 

Amurg is a custom-made Neo-Grotesque Typeface with slightly flared endings. Due to its large x-height and slightly condensed shapes the font is a versatile choice.
It has a balanced and compact texture due to it's short descenders & ascenders together with relatively closed apertures.

The general tone of voice is friendly but confident, suited for both display usage as well as for text.
Discrete yet present, a faithful shadow of spoken words that will never disappear .
